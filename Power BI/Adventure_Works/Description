The AdventureWorks Sales Performance Dashboard is a Power BI project that analyzes sales, profit, and customer trends from 2020 to 2022, revealing $24.9M in revenue, $10.5M in profit, and 25.2K orders with a low 2.2% return rate. Built using Power BI Desktop, DAX calculations, and data modeling techniques, the dashboard highlights consistent revenue growth, a strong 42% profit margin, and key insights into top-performing products like the Fender Set - Mountain and Sport-100 Helmet. 

With these findings, the company can strengthen marketing around high-performing items, address return issues in lower-performing categories, and target customer segments and regions with the highest engagement to drive sustainable business growth.
